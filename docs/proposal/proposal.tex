\textbf{Description:} 

A cross-platform mobile app that recommends posts to users based on their progress in a tv series to avoid spoilers and promote a safe fandom experience. It will have a simple UI similar to Tumblr, where users can read and write text-based posts about fandoms they enjoy. We will implement \hyperref[explanation]{Retrieval-Augmented Generation} to flag spoilers and improve the user experience.

\label{explanation} \textbf{Retrieval Augmented Generation}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a method of allowing llms to respond to queries using supporting information beyond their training data. 

Our implementation will involve retrieving relevant transcript data from a database to inform llm spoiler detection.
