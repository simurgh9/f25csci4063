\textbf{Description:} 

A cross-platform mobile app that recommends posts to users based on their progress in a tv series to avoid spoilers and promote a safe fandom experience. It will have a simple UI similar to Tumblr, where users can read and write text-based posts about fandoms they enjoy. We will implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation to discern and flag spoilers to improve the user experience. 

Should we have time left over, we will expand this to include the ability to post images as well as text, and include fandoms beyond tv shows.
